# ayjkeyclub.github.io

This is a website I made for the A.Y. Jackson S.S Key Club 2016-2017. It was originally owned by a Github account that I specifically made for the club, but decided to transfer it to my personal account. 

It is the first website that I have ever built, so I know the design/ functionality is not the best. Nevertheless, I am extremely proud of it!
